# MalScan - Malware Analysis Lab
A malware analysis lab composed of multiple virtual machines designed to automate malware execution, memory dump collection, and packet capture analysis. It simulates advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios using static and dynamic analysis, reverse engineering, and network forensics techniques.

This project provides a step-by-step setup of a secure virtual environment for analyzing malwares. It involves configuring a Windows VM with analysis tools alongside **REMnux** to perform static and dynamic analysis, network monitoring, and rule-based detection. Ideal for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts seeking hands-on experience in understanding malware behavior and impact.

# VMs used
1. [FlareVM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm)
2. [REMnux](https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance)

A dedicated, isolated network was configured for this lab to ensure the malware remains contained within the virtual environment, preventing any risk of infection to external systems.
